Sockets
Uniquely identified by
    -an internet address
    -an end to end protocol(TCP|UDP)
    -a port number
Two types of (TCP/IP sockets)
    Stream sockets (TCP)
    Datagram sockets (UDP)

A file descriptor is a number that uniquely identifies
an open file
it describes a data resource, and how that resource 
may be accessed


int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);

-domain argument selects the protocol family which will be used for communication
-type pecifies the communication semantics
-the protocol specifies a particular protocol to be used with the
socket.  Normally only a single protocol exists to support a
particular socket type within a given protocol family, in which case
protocol can be specified as 0.
